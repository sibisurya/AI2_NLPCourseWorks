[Awaking] And run through fire
 I will for thy sweet sake. 
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art, 

That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart. 
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word 
Is that vile name to perish on my sword! 

HELENA
  Do not say so, Lysander; say not so 
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though? 
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content. 

LYSANDER
  Content with Hermia! No; I do repent 
The tedious minutes I with her have spent. 
Not Hermia but Helena I love: 

Who will not change a raven for a dove? 

The will of man is by his reason sway'd; 

And reason says you are the worthier maid. 

Things growing are not ripe until their season 

So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason; 

And touching now the point of human skill, 

Reason becomes the marshal to my will 
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook 
Love's stories written in love's richest book. 

HELENA
  Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born? 

When at your hands did I deserve this scorn? 

Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, 

That I did never, no, nor never can, 

Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, 
But you must flout my insufficiency? 
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, 

In such disdainful manner me to woo. 

But fare you well: perforce I must confess 

I thought you lord of more true gentleness. 

O, that a lady, of one man refused. 

Should of another therefore be abused! 
Exit
 LYSANDER
  She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there: 

And never mayst thou come Lysander near! 
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things 
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings, 
Or as tie heresies that men do leave 

Are hated most of those they did deceive, 

So thou, my surfeit and my heresy, 
Of all be hated, but the most of me! 
And, all my powers, addr
ess your love and might 
To honour Helen and to be her knight!
